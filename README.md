# omelette
vb6-db-app-framework

Origin of the project name omelette is i had a delicious omelette dish for dinner last night and I just want to call this project with a simple name.

Objective of this project is to provide a framework to develop database driven applications in vb6 for windows. VB6 is my favourite programming language. It is easy to write a program to work with database such as Ms Access. I found source code in vb6 can be open or read using notepad. My idea is to store some frequently used templates and generate the source code files and use VB6 to compile them as an EXE or DLL.
